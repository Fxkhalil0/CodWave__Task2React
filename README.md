**Short Report: Social Media Feed CodWave Task**

**Task Overview:**
In this project, I was tasked with creating a simple and responsive user interface for a social media feed using the React framework. The challenge was to ensure that the UI looked great on four different screen sizes (1200px, 992px, 768px, and 567px). Below, I will provide an overview of the key features and techniques I used to accomplish this task.

**Key Features:**

**1-Responsive Design:** The social media feed UI is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. It looks great whether you're viewing it on a large desktop monitor or a smaller mobile device.

**2-Component Structure:** To keep the code organized and maintainable, I divided the UI into two main components and two sub-components. This modular structure allowed for easier management and updates.

**3-UseState Hook:** I utilized the useState hook to manage active styles on elements within the feed. This made it possible to toggle between different states, such as adding a friend or canceling a request.

**4-Dynamic Card Items:** To populate the feed, I used the map function to dynamically create card items. This ensured that the content is easily scalable and can accommodate various types of posts.

**5-Add Friend Functionality:** One of the key interactions in a social media feed is the ability to add friends or connections. I implemented this feature using unique IDs and provided a smooth user experience for adding and canceling friend requests.

**Design Inspiration:**
For design inspiration, I referred to a Behance project that aligns with the modern and user-friendly look we wanted to achieve. You can check out the design concept on Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/172132241/Social-Media-Website-Design?tracking_source=search_projects|social+media+website

**Conclusion:**
Creating a responsive social media feed UI was an exciting challenge, and I'm pleased with the results. The UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly for a wide range of devices. The component structure, useState hook, and dynamic card item creation ensure that the code is both maintainable and scalable. I drew inspiration from a Behance design concept and made the code accessible on my GitHub repository for further exploration and development. Thank you to CodWave for this valuable internship opportunity, and I look forward to contributing more to the team's projects in the future.
